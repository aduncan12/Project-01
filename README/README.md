flux capacEATor

The flux capacEATor is an interactive map that connects users with bars and restaurants that have had a long lasting cultural impact on San Francisco. The main list is provided by SF Heritage (www.sfheritage.org), and can be supplemented by user-submitted suggestions. San Francisco has a diverse and compelling history, and we feel one of the best ways to engage with the past is through food and drink at one of the city's many historical establishments.

All cities experience change over time, and it is important to stay connected to the past in order to remember shared experiences that had significant social impacts. It's easy to read a history book or watch a documentary, but to walk into a place that has served their neighborhood and the community as a whole for decades - oftentimes run by the same family - is a feeling that cannot be conveyed through words or pictures. The flux capacEATor hopes to inspire people to step out of their comfort zone and make their own connection to the past.
